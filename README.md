pirouette example 25: the effect of RNG in the alignment for the error distribution

> For a normal RQE 3 run, 6% of 100 runs gives a higher error in the twins, due to bad RNG. Bad RNG can happen in (1) twin tree creation. and (2) alignment creation.
>
> Measure the influence of the alignment RNG, by using a same twin tree, but 100 different alignment RNG seed.
